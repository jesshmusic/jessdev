# NextJS Site with Strapi backend for dev portfolio

This is a simple NextJS/ReactJS site that pulls data from my [Strapi](https://strapi.io) backend. There isn't an admin or login because Strapi already has an admin, and I didn't see the point.

- Animations are created with [Greensock GSAP](https://greensock.com).
- CSS Modules with SCSS for styles
- See the site here: [Jess Hendricks Dev Portfolio Site](https://webdev.existentialmusic.com/)
